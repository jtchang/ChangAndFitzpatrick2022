# FLEAPPy

A modular framework for the analysis of experiment data neuroscience experiments.

To access the full documentation. Run the following command:
```shell
    {FLEAPPY ROOT PATH}/docs> make html
    {FLEAPPY ROOT PATH}/docs/_build/html> python -m http.server 8000
```

This will start up a webserver, and the documentation will be available through any browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000.
A good place to start is the Cookbook, which runs through a hypothetical workflow in Jupyter notebooks.
